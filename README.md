# Password Strength Checker
Essentially this is a small tool that I made that bases off how when signing up for websites it gives a "password strength", this is useful concept to learn in terms of cybersecurity and creating a password that is safe and secure. 

For now this has 5 levels,
1. Very Weak
2. Weak
3. Decent
4. Strong
5. Very Strong

Example 1: - Weak password
